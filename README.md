### Hey!

I'm a first year quantitative finance major at Stevens. I'll be using my github to house projects I work on as I teach myself data visualization and machine learning skills. I'll hopefully be able to apply what I learn towards future quant projects. To anyone at Stevens -- feel free to snoop!

I'll mainly be working in Python, but I'm interested in becoming more proficient in R and learning how to code in SQL / use Tableau. 

My current goal is to realize my passion towards creating pretty charts. And maybe have some fun along the way.
